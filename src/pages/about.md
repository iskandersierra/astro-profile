Hello! I'm Iskander Sierra, a software engineer with over two decades of experience in the tech industry. My journey in software development has been fueled by a passion for creating innovative solutions that make a difference in people's lives. From the early days of coding to leading complex projects, I've enjoyed every moment of my career, constantly learning and adapting to the ever-evolving world of technology.

## Professional Background

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with some incredible teams, building software that powers some complex systems in the energy sector, security and data management and analytics. My expertise spans across various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, and I have a particular knack for problem-solving, learning and optimizing systems for performance and scalability. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think creatively and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

Some key highlights of my career include:

- Learned to code at a young age and have been passionate about software development ever since
- Studied Computer Science at the University of Havana, Cuba
- Worked as programming instructor at the University of Havana
- Moved to Spain to work as software on the energy sector
- Started working as software developer and principal architect for a project in the facility management sector
- Worked as a software engineer in the security sector for a Hungarian company
- Continued working in the facility management sector up to this day

Whether it's developing software from scratch, improving existing systems, or mentoring the next generation of engineers, I bring enthusiasm, experience, and a dedication to quality to every project I undertake.

## My Passion for the Outdoors

When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll likely find me outdoors, embracing my love for climbing and hiking. The mountains have always been my sanctuary, offering a perfect escape from the digital world. Climbing and hiking are not just hobbies for meâ€”they're a way to challenge myself physically and mentally, to explore new terrains, and to connect with nature on a deeper level.

I've tackled some of the most challenging trails and peaks, each adventure teaching me valuable lessons in perseverance, patience, and the importance of preparation. These experiences have not only enriched my life but also enhanced my approach to work, helping me stay focused, resilient, and motivated even in the most demanding situations.

## Balancing Work and Passion

Balancing a thriving career in software engineering with an active lifestyle is something I take pride in. The discipline and focus required in climbing and hiking directly translate to my professional life, where I approach every project with determination and a strategic mindset. Just as every step on a mountain matters, every line of code I write is crafted with precision and care.

Whether it's scaling new heights in my career or on a mountain, I'm driven by a desire to grow, explore, and make the most out of every opportunity.
